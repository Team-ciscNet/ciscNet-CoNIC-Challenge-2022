Directory for the conic_challenge training data. 

1) Copy counts.csv, images.npy, labels.npy from os.lsdf.kit.edu/iai-projects/iai-aida/Daten_CoNIC-Challenge-2022/conic_challenge_patches/conic_challenge/ into 
the conic_patches folder.
2) Run train.py to create the final training dataset.

Training data will be automatically created when running train.py. Upsampled training data will be stored in the upsampled folder (when running train.py with the --upsample argument). Original scale training data will be stored in the original_scale folder (when running train.py without the --upsample argument).
